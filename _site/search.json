    "text": "As a dedicated and detail-oriented professional with 3 years of experience at Northrop Grumman, I have honed my expertise in electronics engineering, data analysis, and project management. During my time at Northrop, I advanced from an internship to a Test Engineer role, where I contributed to process improvements, authored custom test procedures, and collaborated with cross-functional teams on critical testing and manufacturing projects. My work included leveraging tools like VBA and LabVIEW to develop interfaces and analyze data, driving efficiency and accuracy in testing environments.\nI hold a BS in Mathematics with a minor in Analytics from Chapman University, graduating Magna Cum Laude and earning the Outstanding Senior Award. As a student-athlete, I developed strong time management and leadership skills, balancing academics and athletics. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at the University of California, Irvine, further building my skills in Python, RStudio, SQL, and Tableau to solve complex business problems through data-driven solutions.\n\n\n\nWhether it’s collaborating on technical projects, driving data-based insights, or refining operational workflows, I am passionate about applying my analytical mindset to deliver meaningful results. I’m always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in the fields of engineering, technology, sports, and business analytics."
